# Numbers Game

The goal is to correctly guess the random number that's been generated by the computer. You can take as many guesses as you like, and after each guess you will be told if the guess was too low or too high.

The index.html page lets you enter guesses. If you guess correctly you will be taken to win.html, but note, if you try to go to this page without actually having the correct guess, you will be redirected to the index page. If you are tired of guessing and want to be shown the answer, there is an "I give up button," which will route you to answer.html. If you try to directly navigate to this page, you will be given an error message (to keep people from cheating!)

TODO:
* Make it look nicer.
* Add a visualization of the guesses you've made. (Right now the guesses are logged in the console)
* Animate the "Too low/ too high" message.
