# Numbers Game

The goal is to correctly guess the random number that's been generated by the computer. You can take as many guesses as you like, and after each guess you will be told if the guess was too low or too high.

The index.html page lets you enter guesses. If you guess correctly you will be taken to win.html, but note, if you try to go to this page without actually having the correct guess, you will be redirected to the index page. If you are tired of guessing and want to be shown the answer, there is an "I give up button," which will route you to answer.html. If you try to directly navigate to this page, you will be given an error message (to keep people from cheating!)

## Visual feedback
To make the game a bit easier, there is a color spectrum that updates when you make a guess. The idea for the color spectrum is based on the phrase "getting warmer / getting colder." The closer a guess is to the correct answer, the darker red the color will be. The farther it is from the answer, the darker blue it will be. This make it a lot easier to focus in on the area where the answer is. An example is shown below (where the correct answer is 17).
